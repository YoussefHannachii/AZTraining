This repo is composed of 20 azure labs (more specefic to the AZ 900 Certification). 
Each lab focuses on an important aspect/topic on the azure plateform.
I will try to document every task so It can be usefull for anyone trying to prepare for the certification.


PS: This is still a work on progress :)
