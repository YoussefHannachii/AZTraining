# Lab 16: Managing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Task at Hand

- Assign built-in roles to users and groups.
- Create custom roles with specific permissions.
- Audit access using activity logs.

## Steps assign built-in roles and custom rules to groups 

First what we need to do is access one of our ressources group and then go to IAM(access control)

Now you can see that we can add role assignments and choose built-in roles (for this example I will choose the Reader role).

Here you can see that we can choose some members:

Now let's shift our focus to how we can create custom roles with specific permissions.
